    "\n",
    "There is also a single Record tag with HKDataTypeSleepDurationGoal, but it has only two entries and isn't particularly interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ActivitySummary tags\n",
    "\n",
    "These are daily tags showing the goals set for [Apple Watch rings](https://www.apple.com/watch/close-your-rings/) (Move, Exercise and Stand) and the actual values achieved by day. Probably not particularly interesting either, unless compared to other quantities over time like body weight, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Workout tags\n",
    "\n",
    "These have detailed information on each workout performed, including source (e.g., third-party apps, Apple Watch, etc.), calories burned, distance, and links out to workout routes present elsewhere in the `apple_health/` export.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ClinicalRecord tags\n",
    "\n",
    "These are records from clinical visits, including Observations, DiagnosticReports, and more. I don't personally have a ton of these and they are pretty coarse-grained, so probably won't look much deeper into these.\n",

    "##### Audiogram tags\n",
    "\n",
    "I only have two of these, both from AirPods Pro hearing tests. Also not terribly interesting to look at.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The `export.xml` file has a lot of interesting data in it, mainly in the form of various quantities recorded by different biometric sensors, activity summaries from Apple Watch, and workout metadata, but also some less interesting or relevant data. **Will take a look at these in depth in other notebooks.**"
